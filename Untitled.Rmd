## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

matrix <- read.csv("/Users/arihangupta/Downloads/PhiCB5-Analysis-2023/20230510_LZ22332_500nM_induced_3hour_026.txt")
numCols <- ncol(matrix)
for (i in 1:numCols)
{
  columnData <- matrix[,i]
  hist(columnData, main = paste("histogram of column", i), xlab = "value", col = "lightblue", breaks = 40)
}
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
